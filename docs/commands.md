# Commands.md #

A list of available bot commands, and how they are used. May not be
completely up to date, just throw something at one of us on irc or file an
issue if you find any out of date content.

This is in addition to `Hex: help` and `Hex: a help`, as it is more
comprehensive and detailed (and easier to read). It is divided into two
sections; user commands and admin commands.
