# Commands.md #

A list of available bot commands, and how they are used. May not be
completely up to date, just throw something at one of us on irc or file an
issue if you find any out of date content.

This is in addition to `Hex: help` and `Hex: a help`, as it is more
comprehensive and detailed (and easier to read). It is divided into two main
sections; user commands and admin commands.


## Calling the bot ##

There are a couple ways to call the bot. You can either send it a private
message, or you can send it in the channel by prefixing "Hex" to it:

```irc
<callumacrae> Hex: help
<@Hex> callumacrae: Currently available commands:
<@Hex> callumacrae: about, admin (a), buydomain, cpanel (cp), dns, domainadd,
            flushdns, google (d), help, lmgtfy, mysql, paid, tickets, tos, upgrade,
            uptime, wiki (w), wolframalpha (wa) and whoami.
```

The colon is entirely optional, and both the bot name and commands are
not case sensitive.


### Directing a command ###

You can direct a command at someone using the `@` operator:

```irc
<callumacrae> Hex: help @ GtoXic
<@Hex> GtoXic: Currently available commands:
<@Hex> GtoXic: about, admin (a), buydomain, cpanel (cp), dns, domainadd, flushdns,
            google (d), help, lmgtfy, mysql, paid, tickets, tos, upgrade, uptime, wiki
            (w), wolframalpha (wa) and whoami.
```

## Admin Commands ##

Admin commands can be accessed by appending the command with "admin "
or "a ". For example:

```irc
<callumacrae> Hex: a ban Dead-i
```

They require the user calling them to be of a certain admin level (specified
below the commands below by "Level"). Failing to be of that level will result
in an error (or if they're not an admin at all, it will fail silently).


### help ###
**Aliases:** h
**Level:** 0

```
Hex: a help [ all ]
```

Sends the user a list of admin commands that they can use, or if they
specify "all", it gives them more detail about each command (but it doesn't
contain quite as much detail as this document).

It is sent in multiple private messages, not into the channel you requested
it in (assuming you requested it in a channel).


### ban ###

### join ###
**Aliases:** None
**Level:** 7

```
Hex: a join <channel>
```

Commands the bot to join the specified channel. If it is banned from that
channel, it will *not* try to join the channel again or try to unban itself, it
just won't join.


### kick ###
**Aliases:** None
**Level:** 3

```
Hex: a kick <user> [ <channel> ]
```

Kicks the specified user from either the current channel or the specified

to rejoin immediately.

**Aliases:** None
